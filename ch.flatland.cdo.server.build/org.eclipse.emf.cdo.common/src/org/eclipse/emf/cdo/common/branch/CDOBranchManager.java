/**
 * Manages a tree of {@link CDOBranch branches} and notifies about changes in this branch tree.
 * <p>
 * The branch tree is represented by a {@link #getMainBranch() main} branch, which, like all
 * {@link CDOBranch#getBranches() sub} branches, offers the major part of the branching functionality. A branch manager
 * provides additional methods to find branches by their unique integer ID or by their fully qualified path name, as
 * well as asynchronous bulk queries.
 * <p>
 * A branch manager can fire the following events:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link CDOBranchChangedEvent} after a new branch has been created, renamed or deleted.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Branch managers are usually associated with the following entities:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>org.eclipse.emf.cdo.session.CDOSession</code>
 * <li> <code>org.eclipse.emf.cdo.server.IRepository</code>
 * </ul>
